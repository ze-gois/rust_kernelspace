<H3>ELF and ABI Standards</H3>
<P>
The Executable and Linking Format (ELF) Specification describes the widely
used executable file format. The Application Binary Interface (ABI)
Specifications define Operating System and Application interfaces that are
neccesary to construct an execution environment for applications.

<A HREF="/elf/TIS1.1.pdf">Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Portable Formats
Specification, version 1.1</A>. 1993 document containing an extract of the
x86 ABI version 3.0, DWARF 2.0 draft and OMF
<LI>
<A HREF="/elf/elf.pdf">Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Portable Formats
Specification, version 1.2</A>. 1995 document containing only the ELF
Specification. This version breaks ELF into 3 seperate books, ELF, x86 psABI,
and the Operating System Specific Specification for SVR4. This appears to be
the most current TIS specification.

<A HREF="/elf/gabi41.pdf">System V ABI Edition 4.1</A>. 1997 document containing
the most recent ABI standard. This document is known as the Generic ABI (gABI)
and must be used in conjunction with a Processor Suppliment aBI (psABI)
document.

<A HREF="/elf/gabi4+/contents.html">System V ABI - DRAFT 24 April 2001</A>. 2001
update to chapters 4 and 5 of the gABI. This version is one of several
updates listed in draft status.

<A HREF="/elf/elfspec_ppc.pdf">System V Application Binary Interface PowerPC
Processor Supplment</A>.  This is one of two known PPC ELF standards.
This one was developed by SunSoft. The two versions are not identical,
and applications can only conform to one or the other,
while it seems possible for an implementation to support both simulaneously.
